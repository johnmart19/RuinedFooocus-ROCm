## NOTE YOU WILL NEED TO EXTRACT USING THE LATEST [7ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

In the first time you launch the software, it will automatically download models:

1. It will download [sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors from here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/resolve/main/sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors) as the file "Fooocus\models\checkpoints\sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors".

If you already have these files, you can copy them to the above locations to speed up installation.

Note that if you see **"MetadataIncompleteBuffer"**, then your model files are corrupted. Please download models again.

### Linux

The command lines are

    git clone https://github.com/runew0lf/RuinedFooocus.git
    cd RuinedFooocus
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements_versions.txt

Then download the models: download [sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors from here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/resolve/main/sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors) as the file "Fooocus\models\checkpoints\sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors", and download [sd_xl_refiner_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors from here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0/resolve/main/sd_xl_refiner_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors) as the file "Fooocus\models\checkpoints\sd_xl_refiner_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors". **Or let Fooocus automatically download the models** using the launcher:

    python launch.py

Or if you want to open a remote port, use

    python launch.py --listen
